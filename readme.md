## Titled : Super Hero Gifs

Created with intent to learn more about how to use API and JSON calls. This was also my first attempt at using local storage to store favorites.

## Motivation

In this project I wanted to set up a single page website that would dynamically adapt to the requests, and allow for new buttons, and gifs to apear and clear without resetting the page.

I used Bootstrap, and use CSS to clean things up to make it all flow neatly.

## How To Use The WebApp

https://mcpolichette.github.io/Super_Hero_Giphy_API/

At the top of the website there are many buttons with SuperHero's names. When clicked it will generate a number of images from Giphy's database below.

- click these images to see them move.

- You can generate new buttons by writing a superhero's name in the form and clicking the search button.

- You can also save a Gif as a favorite by clicking the Green button below any image, and view all your selected favorites at once with the FAVORITES button next to the form.

- If you have any questions about navigating the site, you can email me at: Mark@Polichette.com
